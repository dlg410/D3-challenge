          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <br>
          <p> There is clearly a relationship between household income  and the occurrence 
              of obesity and smoking.  The higher the income the less likeliness of these two measures of health risks. Analyzing 
              Household Income against Lacks Healthcare, there is a noticeable increase of risk with lesser incomes.  Again, the 
              Southeastern States rank poorer than other states for healthcare, and the Northeastern states are faring better.  
              Two individual sates are on the extremes; TX and MA would be worth looking into for reasons as to why TX has such a 
              high percentage of population lacking healthcare, and why MA is very low.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p> As expected, there is a negative correlation between age and percentage of the population lacking healthcare.
              This can be seen as the younger generations struggle to secure jobs that provide healthcare. Another contributing
              factor could be that healthcare becomes a higher priority the older one gets.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p> Overall, a general trend can be seen that with the increase of poverty percentage within a US state, 
              there is an increase in all health concerns.  Additional observation reveals a trend of higher poverty 
              percentages in Southeastern States, along with higher incidences of percentages of all three comparisons provided.
